# Commit 2: Analyzing the problem space

There are two bounded contexts, Sponsors and Trials

We also require a way to validate if a Country is valid, as it's not a bounded context on its own,
I've set the code in a shared kernel

Here a diagram of the domain model:

```
+-----------------+      +-----------------+
|  Sponsors       |<-----+  Trials         |
|                 |      |                 |
+-----------------+      +-------+---------+
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
                                 v
                         +-------+---------+
                         |  Shared Kernel  |
                         |                 |
                         +-----------------+
```

This lead me to the following directory structure:

```
src
â”œâ”€â”€ apps
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trials
â”œâ”€â”€ infra
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ console
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ http
â””â”€â”€ modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ common
    â”œâ”€â”€ sponsors
    â””â”€â”€ trials
```

- `apps` contains the entry points for the different applications -- `http` is the app that
  retrieves the different routes exposed by the `modules` to build a REST API -- `trials` is the app
  that runs the CLI for the customer success team
- `infra` contains the code that is specific to the infrastructure (code that can be shared between
  the apps and the modules) -- `common` contains code that is technology-agnostic -- `console`
  contains code that is specific to the console apps (CLI) -- `http` contains code that is specific
  to the REST APIs
- `modules` contains the code for the different bounded contexts -- `common` is the shared kernel --
  `sponsors` is the bounded context for the sponsors -- `trials` is the bounded context for the
  trials

## Monorepo

As the goal is to build the first parts of a larger-scale software, I've decided to use a monorepo

## [Modular monolith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OjqD-ow8GE)

As each component is a different npm package, you can easily work on your projects without impacting
the other ones

For example, if there is bug in `@inato/modules-trials@1.1.0`, I can easily revert the prod version
to `1.0.0` without having to deploy `@inato/modules-sponsors` again

I actually haven't had time to implement the ACLs between the different modules, thus the modules
are less modular than I would have liked

Here is what using a use case from the `sponsors` bounded context in the `trials` bounded context
looks like:

```typescript
import { handlers } from "@inato/modules-sponsors";

const getSponsorByName = handlers.getSponsorByName;
```

Which leads to a huge coupling between the two modules, leaking the ubiquitous language from one
bounded context to the other one.

# Before I forget

The `README.md` file is outdated in the repository as the example for the first step is incorrect in
2023

I would update it myself, but I don't want to use my Github account to make a pull request on a
technical test repository ðŸ˜„

# Commit 1: Initialization

Creating the root package and installing the tools and dependencies I'll use

## Tools

- [x] [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

I'm using it more like a tool to format the code for me and make everything consistent, this is why
I disable a lot of rules that prevent me from working (for example
`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` as there is nothing wrong with using `any` in some precise
cases, mostly with generics and type inference)

- [x] [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [x] [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## Dependencies

- [x] [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)

To color the console output

- [x] [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander)

To create the CLI

- [x] [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns)

Make it easier to work with dates

- [x] [fastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify)

I've compared all the major alternatives to look for the framework with the best TypeScript support
and Fastify was the winner, even though it's not great at it

- [x] [fp-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fp-ts)

I've seen that it is part of Inato's stack, and I've been looking for an excuse to try it out

Note that I have some experience with functional programming (I've worked with F# and Haskell in my
personal time) but I've never used fp-ts before

- [x] [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod)

Schema validation with static type inference

I know the de facto standard for working with fp-ts is io-ts, but I've never used it before and
using fp-ts was already a big enough challenge for me

## No framework

The only "framework" I'm using is Fastify, which is a very thin layer on top of Node.js

I'm part of the [frameworkless movement](https://frameworklessmovement.org/) as I do see the appeal
behind frameworks, but I think they don't replace the need for a good architecture and good design,
and they often get in the way of that I'm trying to achieve

My bigger issue with frameworks is that they are often very opinionated, and they restrain our
creativity
